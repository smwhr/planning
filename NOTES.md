# Planning


## Notes
- Object equality is on equality of classtype + members equality : how deep ?
- A task can't have a cost if it isn't assigned
- Maybe create a MythicalCreature that accomplishes a task in nominal time
- Distinguish between Future estimate and past logged hours


## Strategies

### Logged hours
 - Scan bitbucket for commits (from `start of day`* to `end of day`)
  * Person is working on project A until commit happends
 - Scan slack for messages
  * Treated as interruption
  * Works on project A as long as there's less than 10' between answers on a channel
